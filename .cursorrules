# Cursor AI Rules - Template Project

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST

**BEFORE making ANY changes to code or creating files, you MUST:**

1. **Read `docs/workflow/BEST_PRACTICES.md`** - This is MANDATORY
2. **Check with the user** before:
   - Writing or modifying code
   - Creating new files (except documentation in `docs/`)
   - Running commands that modify the codebase
   - Committing or pushing to GitHub

## Workflow Rules

1. **Understand** - Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. **Propose** - Explain what you'll do and why
3. **Wait for approval** - Get explicit confirmation before proceeding
4. **Implement** - Only after approval
5. **Verify** - Check that changes work as expected

## Testing Requirements

After any code is developed:
- **ALWAYS propose a test** in a `.py` file that can be run
- Test should display logs in the terminal
- User must be able to run the test

## Documentation

- Documentation files (`.md` files in `docs/`) can be created/updated without explicit approval
- Code files require explicit approval before modification

## Reference Files

- **BEST_PRACTICES.md**: `docs/workflow/BEST_PRACTICES.md`
- **GIT_WORKFLOW.md**: `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`

**These rules are non-negotiable. Always refer back to BEST_PRACTICES.md before making changes.**
