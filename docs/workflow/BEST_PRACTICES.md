# Best Practices & Workflow Guidelines

## ⚠️ Critical Rules

### Before Any Code Changes
- ✅ **ALWAYS check with the user before:**
  - Writing or modifying code
  - Creating new files (except documentation)
  - Pushing to GitHub
  - Running commands that modify the codebase

### once ne code is developed. 
- ✅ **ALWAYS confirm with the user before:**
  - always propose a test in .py file that can be run either by you and display a log in the terminal or by me 


### Before Pushing to GitHub
- ✅ **ALWAYS confirm with the user before:**
  - Committing changes
  - Pushing to any branch
  - Creating new branches (unless explicitly requested)

## Workflow

1. **Understand the requirement** - Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. **Propose the approach** - Explain what you'll do
3. **Wait for approval** - Get explicit confirmation before proceeding
4. **Implement** - Only after approval
5. **Verify** - Check that changes work as expected

## Documentation

- Documentation files (`.md` files in `docs/`) can be created/updated without explicit approval
- Code files require explicit approval before modification

## Communication

- Be clear about what you're planning to do
- Explain the "why" behind your approach
- Wait for confirmation before executing
