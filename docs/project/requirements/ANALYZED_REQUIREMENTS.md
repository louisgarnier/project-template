# Analyzed Requirements

This document contains the rephrased, clarified, and structured requirements derived from `RAW_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Analysis Process

Requirements are analyzed to:
- **Clarify ambiguity** - Remove vague terms, add specifics
- **Identify dependencies** - Understand what needs to come first
- **Categorize** - Group related requirements
- **Prioritize** - Identify must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- **Break down** - Separate complex requirements into smaller parts

## Requirements Overview

<!-- High-level summary of all requirements -->

---

## Categorized Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<!-- Clear, actionable functional requirements -->

### Non-Functional Requirements

<!-- Performance, security, usability, etc. -->

### Constraints & Assumptions

<!-- Technical constraints, business rules, assumptions -->

---

## Requirements Breakdown

### Priority 1 (Must Have)
<!-- Critical requirements for MVP -->

### Priority 2 (Should Have)
<!-- Important but not blocking -->

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
<!-- Enhancements for future iterations -->

---

## Functionalities Identified

<!-- List of functionalities that will be created as separate feature files -->

1. **[Functionality Name 1]** - Brief description
2. **[Functionality Name 2]** - Brief description
3. **[Functionality Name 3]** - Brief description

---

## Next Steps

1. Create feature files in `../features/` for each functionality
2. Break down each functionality into implementation steps
3. Link features back to requirements for traceability
