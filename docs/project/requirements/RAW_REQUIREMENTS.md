# Raw Requirements

This document captures the initial, unprocessed requirements for the project. Requirements can be provided in any format - bullet points, paragraphs, user stories, etc.

## How to Use

1. **Add your requirements below** - Write them as you think of them, in any format
2. **Don't worry about structure** - We'll analyze and rephrase them together
3. **Include context** - Add any relevant background information, constraints, or priorities

## Notes & Context

<!-- Add any additional context, constraints, priorities, or questions here -->

**Next Step**: Once requirements are added, we'll analyze and rephrase them in `ANALYZED_REQUIREMENTS.md`
