# Feature Documentation

This directory contains documentation for project features (functionalities) broken down from analyzed requirements.

## Structure

- Create a new `.md` file for each major functionality
- Use descriptive names: `FEATURE_NAME.md` (e.g., `USER_AUTHENTICATION.md`)
- Each file contains the complete breakdown with implementation steps
- Link back to requirements in `../requirements/ANALYZED_REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Workflow

1. **Requirements** → Added to `../requirements/RAW_REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. **Analysis** → Rephrased in `../requirements/ANALYZED_REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. **Functionalities** → Created here as individual `.md` files
4. **Steps** → Each functionality file contains detailed implementation steps
5. **Implementation** → Follow steps to build the feature

See `../requirements/REQUIREMENTS_WORKFLOW.md` for the complete workflow guide.

## Template

Use `../requirements/TEMPLATE.md` as the starting point for each feature file.

The template includes:
- Requirements breakdown
- Technical specifications
- Testing requirements
- **Implementation Plan** with step-by-step breakdown

## Best Practices

- ✅ Document features before implementation
- ✅ Break functionalities into clear, actionable steps
- ✅ Each step should be completable in 1-2 days
- ✅ Include acceptance criteria for each step
- ✅ Document dependencies between steps
- ✅ Link back to analyzed requirements
- ✅ Update documentation as features evolve
- ✅ Include examples and use cases
- ✅ Reference related features
